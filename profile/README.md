# purpl & What we do

Welcome to purpl!</br>
We are a small team of developers focused on writing cool & useful software.

We mostly work on vector and vector related projects, however we may work on some other projects in the future.

# Our projects

## purplOS

purplOS is our stable Vector OS.</br>
Here you can enjoy a good user experience, but without the bugs & experimental features of redOS.

## redOS

redOS is our experimental Vector OS.</br>
Our focus with redOS is to create and test experimental features that may take a while to complete, in an environment that doesn't need to have stable releases.</br>

Things may break from time to time using redOS, but thats okay! Thats part of the process of making cool things.

## Where can I download these OSes?

The latest OTA of purplOS is available at: http://update-server.api.froggitti.net:81/latest/dev.ota</br>
The latest OTA of redOS is available at: http://api.froggitti.net/ota/purpl/latest_redOS.ota</br>
